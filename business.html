              <p class="card-text">Like many immigrant families, my first generation Korean parents have worked through blood, sweat, and tears to build this proud business of their own in hopes to support a better life for my siblings and me. My parents have worked 365 days a year for as long as I can remember and have never taken off for holidays. Over the years, they have grown deeply fond of the customers in the community with love that’s close to family. They’ve worked long enough to even witness multiple generations of family come in to buy newborn shoes, back to school shoes, new-job shoes and even birthday shoes. They have grown up with the community. </p>

My uncle, my father, and their oldest brother traveled via ship from Korea for almost two months and landed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with the hopes of finally making it to America. They lived in Argentina for a year, before they were finally able to make it to the United States. Since their arrival, they haven't stopped working. He won't admit it, but he needs your help. What he lost wasn't just his retirement, it was the American Dream .  Please help him recoup what's left of that dream.</p>
